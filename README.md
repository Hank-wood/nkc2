## What it does/ How it works
- serves static files
- render then serve .jade files
- ...if paths are properly routed with express
- provide RESTful APIs for community forums
- document storage and query using ArangoDB
- uses socket.io for real-time notifications

## This may be
- an example for those new to Node.js and express
- and Jade
- and ArangoDB
- btw Angular 1 sucks, don't use it

## First steps
  1. Install Node.js for your system
  2. `git clone` this project, or extract from zip, to somewhere
  3. `npm update` there
  4. run start.bat in Explorer (on Windows), or run start.command in Finder (may need chmod +x first), or `sh` start.command (POSIX)
  5. Press **Enter** in terminal window whenever to restart server

## Should you have
- ArangoDB listening on 8529

## For your convenience
- by default listens on localhost:1086
- server_settings.js includes several globally used server parameters
- GET `server_address:port/html/jade/somename` will respond with rendered `/nkc_modules/jade/somename.jade`
- everything under `/jquery`, `/angular` and `/chat` will be served static at `/`.
- Every unrouted path will end up returning 404.jade
- `query_functions.js` is the database wrapper
- `api_functions.js` contains all the API functions. Then we can call them when serving HTML requests
