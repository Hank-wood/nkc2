## What it does/ How it works
- serves static files
- render then serve .jade files
- ...if paths are properly routed with express
- provide RESTful APIs for community forums
- document storage and query using ArangoDB
- uses socket.io for real-time notifications
- upload and download of attachments


## This may be
- an example for those new to Node.js and express
- and Jade
- and ArangoDB
- btw Angular 1 sucks, don't use it


## To Get Started
1. Install Node.js for your system and make sure `npm` is available as a command
2. `git clone` this project, or extract from zip, to somewhere nice
3. `npm update` there for the dependencies
4. Make sure ArangoDB is listening on __localhost:8529__, then run __db_restore.command__ from Finder (OS X: may need `chmod +x` first) or `sh db_restore.command` (UNIX) to load the database from JSON files
5. run __run_as_dev.bat__ or __run_as_dev.command__ to start the server in a CLI environment
6. Press **Enter** in terminal window whenever to restart server. You may also visit `server:port/reload` to do the same

## 讲国语啦
1. 为你的操作系统安装Node.js，并确保 `npm` 命令在命令行中可用
2. 通过 `git clone` 或者zip解压将项目弄到某处
3. `npm update` 以获取依赖项
4. 确保 ArangoDB 在 __localhost:8529__ 监听, 然后从Finder运行 __db_restore.command__ (OS X: 可能需要先 `chmod +x`) 或者 `sh db_restore.command` (UNIX) 以将JSON文件载入数据库
5. 运行 __run_as_dev.bat__ or __run_as_dev.command__ 以从命令行启动服务器
6. 在命令行窗口中随时按下 **Enter** 就可以重启服务器。 你也可以访问 `server:port/reload` 实现同样效果

## For your convenience
- by default listens on __localhost:1086__
- `server_settings.js` includes several globally used server parameters and static serving routes and URL rewrites
- GET `server:port/html/jade/somename` will respond with rendered `/nkc_modules/jade/somename.jade`
- Every unrouted path will end up returning 404.jade
- `markdown`, `bbcode` and `plain` is available as filters when rendering .jade files using `require('jaderender')(filename,options)`.
- `query_functions.js` is the database wrapper
- `api_functions.js` contains all the API functions. They are called before serving API/HTML requests
- `whatever_handlers.js` contains route endpoints, in the form of __Express__ middlewares.
