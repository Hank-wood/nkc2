## What it does/ How it works
- serves static files
- render then serve .jade files
- ...if paths are properly routed with express
- provide RESTful APIs for community forums
- document storage and query using ArangoDB
- uses socket.io for real-time notifications


## This may be
- an example for those new to Node.js and express
- and Jade
- and ArangoDB
- btw Angular 1 sucks, don't use it


## To Get Started
  1. Install Node.js for your system and make sure `npm` is available as a command.
  2. `git clone` this project, or extract from zip, to somewhere nice
  3. `npm update` there for the dependencies.
  4. Make sure ArangoDB is listening on localhost:8529, then run __db_restore.command__ from Finder (OS X: may need `chmod +x` first) or `sh db_restore.command` (UNIX) to load the database.
  5. run __start.bat__ from Explorer (on Windows), or run __start.command__ from Finder (OS X: may need `chmod +x` first) or `sh` __start.command__ (UNIX) to start the server in a CLI environment.
  6. Press **Enter** in terminal window whenever to restart server. You may also visit `server:port/reload` to do the same.


## For your convenience
- by default listens on __localhost:1086__
- `server_settings.js` includes several globally used server parameters and static serving routes
- GET `server:port/html/jade/somename` will respond with rendered `/nkc_modules/jade/somename.jade`
- Every unrouted path will end up returning 404.jade
- `markdown`, `bbcode` and `plain` is available as filters when rendering .jade files using `require('jaderender')(filename,options)`.
- `query_functions.js` is the database wrapper
- `api_functions.js` contains all the API functions. They are called before serving API/HTML requests
- `whatever_handlers.js` contains route endpoints, in the form of __Express__ middlewares.
